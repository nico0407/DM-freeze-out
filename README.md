# Dark Matter freeze-out

Things I still need to do:
- Unpolarize all the cross sections and recompute the freeze-out both for just the dark photon mediator and for the dark photon+dark scalar mediator;
- Find out if the parameters used are correct in the scalar cross section;
- Understand if the differential equation is solved correctly in the total model;
- Still the problem with the analytical formula of the decay diagram;
- Understand which kind of result physically am I getting.

Then vary the parameter space and look for possible pheno.

Copy the iDM.....unpolarized file and change masses of DM particles. Change the coannihilation cross section, need to insert the hadrons production in the final state. Same for the scalar coannihilation. Integrate again.
