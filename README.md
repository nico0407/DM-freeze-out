# Dark Matter freeze-out

Things I still need to do:
- Unpolarize all the cross sections and recompute the freeze-out both for just the dark photon mediator and for the dark photon+dark scalar mediator;
- Find out if the parameters used are correct in the scalar cross section;
- Understand if the differential equation is solved correctly in the total model;
- Still the problem with the analytical formula of the decay diagram;
- Understand which kind of result physically am I getting.

Then vary the parameter space and look for possible pheno.
