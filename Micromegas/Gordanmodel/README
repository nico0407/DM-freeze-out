Installation of a new model.

The model of particle interaction has to be defined in the    
CalcHEP format,   Comput.Phys.Commun. 184 (2013) 1729-1769 //arXiv:arXiv:1207.6082[hep-ph] 

1. Define the model  by writing the
  extlib1.mdl  func1.mdl  lgrng1.mdl  prtcls1.mdl  vars1.mdl 
 model files and put these files in the  directory work/models/.
   LanHEP program  can help  you to generate model files. 
   Odd  particles (particles of DM sector) should have a name starting with "~". 

2. To check your model, go to work/  and launch 
   ./calchep 
Use "Check Model"  to get  information  about   model inconsistencies. 
  
2. External constraints. 
If your model has external functions  they have to be realized in 
the as a  library lib/aLib.a. If your external function do not need other 
libraries and are presented by C-code, then put this code in lib/
subdirectory. The library will be compiled automatically.  In more compensated case,
improve  lib/Makefile
 
3. We provide the  user with  two examples of main programs: 
main.c and main.F

Compilation of executable is launched by 

    gmake  main=<name of your main file>

if gmake is absent, use make. We assume that in such case make works like 
gmake.
