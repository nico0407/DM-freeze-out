iDM_yes_hadrons_no_scalar.ipynb ----> THIS IS NOT ANYMORE WITH THE EPSILON**2, BUT WITH THE d_V^f AND THE OTHER RELVANT PARAMETHERS.

iDM_yes_hadrons_no_scalar_modified.ipynb ---->  INSTEAD THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE NON MODIFIED ONE BECAUSE I HAVE NOTICE THAT THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION IS INCORRECT WRITTEN DOWN IN THAT WAY. THE DECAY THERMAL AVERAGE CROSS SECTION HAS JUST (1/H) INSTEAD OF (S/H) AST THE OTHERS, AND MOREOVER THAT DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE, SO I HAVE CHANGED IT. MOREOVER THERE IS ALSO TO MODIFY THE SCATTERING PART. IS THE Y_f^(0) THE EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION OF THE EELCTRON? IF SO I NEED TO MODIFY IT!!!!!!
