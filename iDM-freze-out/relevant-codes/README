## iDM_yes_hadrons_no_scalar.ipynb ----> THIS IS NOT ANYMORE WITH THE EPSILON**2, BUT WITH THE d_V^f AND THE OTHER RELVANT PARAMETHERS. IN ALL THE FILES IN THIS FOLDER

## iDM_yes_hadrons_no_scalar_modified.ipynb ---->  INSTEAD THIS DIFFERENT FROM THE NON MODIFIED ONE BECAUSE I HAVE NOTICE THAT THE BOLTZMANN EQUATION IS INCORRECT WRITTEN DOWN IN THAT WAY. THE DECAY THERMAL AVERAGE CROSS SECTION HAS JUST (1/H) INSTEAD OF (S/H) AST THE OTHERS, AND MOREOVER THAT DEPENDS ON THE TEMPERATURE, SO I HAVE CHANGED IT. MOREOVER THERE IS ALSO TO MODIFY THE SCATTERING PART. IS THE Y_f^(0) THE EQUILIBRIUM DISTRIBUTION OF THE EELCTRON? IF SO I NEED TO MODIFY IT!!!!!!

## iDM_yes_hadrons_no_scalar_modified_electron_equilibrium.ipynb -----> Should be the correct one finally with also the equilibrium function of the electron. BUT THE RESULT IS TOO BAD.


BUT

## IN OUR MODEL PROBABLY THERE IS A FACTOR MORE... WHEN EXPANDING THE INTERACTION TERMS THERE IA A PREFACTOR OF COS (BETA), COS (W) AND TAN (CHI).... REMEBER TO SQUARE THEM
## THOSE SHOUD BE ADDED IN THE INTERACTION TERM? 
IF d_V^f is without them is something prop to 10E-7
IF d_V^f is with them is something prop to 10E-13!!!

In this latter case the value is too low to be possible. 
epsilon^2=1E-6 and gives me the same result as Gordan.. look at the previous folder to iDM- integratuion...unpolarized.ipytm (Always with the decay and scattering issue enyway (1/H and Y_f^(0) respectively)...)
